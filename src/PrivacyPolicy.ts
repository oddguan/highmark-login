I. Uses and Disclosures of Protected Health Information
In order to administer our health benefit programs effectively, we will
collect, use and disclose protected health information for certain of our
activities, including payment and health care operations.

A. Uses and Disclosures of Protected Health Information for

    ►For example:
We may use and disclose your protected health information to pay
claims from doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and others for services
delivered to you that are covered by your health plan, to determine
your eligibility for benefits, to coordinate benefits, to examine
medical necessity, to obtain premiums, and/or to issue explanations
of benefits/payments to the person who subscribes to the health
plan in which you participate.
Health Care Operations
We may use and disclose your protected health information for all
activities that are included within the definition of “health care
operations” as set out in 45 C.F.R. § 164.501. We have not listed in

B. Uses and Disclosures of Protected Health Information
To Other Entities
We also may use and disclose protected health information
to other covered entities, business associates, or other individuals
(as permitted by the HIPAA Privacy Rule) who assist us in
administering our programs and delivering services to our members.
(i) Business Associates.
In connection with our payment and health care operations activities,
we contract with individuals and entities (called “business
associates”) to perform various functions on our behalf or to provide
certain types of services (such as member service support, utilization
management, subrogation, or pharmacy benefit management).
To perform these functions or to provide the services, business
associates will receive, create, maintain, use, or disclose protected
health information, but only after we require the business associates
to agree in writing to contract terms designed to appropriately
safeguard your information.
(ii) Other Covered Entities.
In addition, we may use or disclose your protected health information
to assist health care providers in connection with their treatment or
payment activities, or to assist other covered entities in connection

the disclosure is in your best interest.
O. Underwriting
We may disclose your protected health information for underwriting
purposes; however, we are prohibited from using or disclosing your

P. Health Information Exchange
We will participate in a Health Information Exchange (HIE). An HIE
is primarily a secure electronic data sharing network. In accordance
with federal and state privacy regulations, regional health care providers
participate in the HIE to exchange patient information in order to
facilitate health care, avoid duplication of services, such as tests, and to
reduce the likelihood that medical errors will occur.
The HIE allows your health information to be shared among authorized
participating healthcare providers, such as health systems, hospitals
and physicians, for the purposes of Treatment, Payment or Healthcare
Operations purposes. Examples of this health information may include:
• General laboratory, pathology, transcribed radiology reports and
EKG Images.
• Results of outpatient diagnostic testing (GI testing, cardiac
testing, neurological testing, etc.)
• Health Maintenance documentation/Medication
• Allergy documentation/Immunization profiles
• Progress notes/Urgent Care visit progress notes
• Consultation notes
• Inpatient operative reports
• Discharge summary/Emergency room visit discharge
 summary notes
All participating providers who provide services to you will have
the ability to access your information. Providers that do not provide
services to you will not have access to your information. Information
may be provided to others as necessary for referral, consultation,
treatment or the provision of other healthcare services, such as
pharmacy or laboratory services. All participating providers have
agreed to a set of standards relating to their use and disclosure of the
information available through the HIE. Your health information shall be
available to all participating providers through the HIE.
You cannot choose to have only certain providers access your
information. Patients who do not want their health information to
be accessible through the HIE may choose not to participate or
may “opt-out.”
In order to opt-out, you must call the customer service number located
on the back of your membership card. You should be aware, if you
choose to opt-out, your health care providers will not be able to access
your health information through the HIE. Even if you chose to opt-out,
your information will be sent to the HIE, but providers will not be able
to access this information. Additionally, your opt-out does not affect the
ability of participating providers to access health information entered
into the HIE prior to your opt-out submission.

The following is a description of disclosures that we are required by law
to make:
